# Deterministic Multimodal Analytics Stack

This repository implements a deterministic, domain-agnostic analytics stack with a FastAPI backend, Postgres storage, and a React/Vite frontend. The backend provides CSV and artifact ingestion, multimodal feature extraction, deterministic training and inference, and reproducibility tooling. The frontend exposes dataset management, training, runs, and prediction workflows.
